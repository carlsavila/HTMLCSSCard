                    <p>
                        She studied Graphic Design at the École
                        supérieure des arts decoratifs in Strasbourg, graduating in 2000.
                        Her main activities revolve around typography, layout and the printed object, and she works on
                        both
                        commissioned and self-initiated projects.

                <blockquote class="designer-quote">
                    "The color is fundamental to my work. I use it functionally (classification, hierarchy of content)
                    and poetic. Often the forms I create are very geometric, rigid, organized. Plasticity and poetry
                    involved with color, that flows through these forms, sometimes freely and randomly when I leave an
                    element of chance in printing. But I can also say that it is invested differently in different
                    projects related to the content."
